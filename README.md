This project enables real-time object detection using a USB webcam connected to a Raspberry Pi 4. It leverages OpenCV's DNN module and a pre-trained SSD MobileNet model for identifying common household items. A Flask web server streams the live feed with detected objects, accessible on other devices via a web browser. Ideal for home automation or monitoring tasks using lightweight AI on edge devices.
